        The Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club, also known as the Reaper Crew, is an outlaw motorcycle club on the FX original series Sons of Anarchy and its spinoff Mayans MC. The club was formed in Charming, California, in 1967 by two Vietnam War veterans, John "JT" Teller and Piermont "Piney" Winston, as well as other members comprising the First 9.

Six of the original nine members were war veterans. Their logo is a Grim Reaper wielding an M-16 rifle with scythe blade and holding a crystal ball with the symbol for Anarchy. The Sons' mottos are "Fear the Reaper" and "Ride Free or Die". Their colors are blue and white. The club has 48 chapters worldwide. In North America, these are located in Alaska, Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, New England, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Nevada, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wyoming in the United States, and Alberta and Manitoba in Canada. There are also a number of chapters in Britain, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and Scandinavia.

The series follows the club's mother charter, the Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club Redwood Original, or SAMCRO. Their primary business is importing illegal weapons and selling them to drug gangs in the East Bay, along with protection runs for local businesses by protecting valuable truck shipments from hijacking. They also protect Charming from outside gangs who try to manufacture and sell drugs, mainly methamphetamine. The Sons of Anarchy also have a number of allies in the form of the True IRA, which supplies them with illegal Russian-made guns, and the One-Niners, an African American street gang to which SAMCRO sells weapons, and various affiliates in the state prison system.
