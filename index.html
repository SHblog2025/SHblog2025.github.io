<h2>The Meme</h2>
<p>I thought I would try to have a little fun with this first project by using a meme as my picture. I had to go back a few times to see what I was doing wrong.<p>

<h3>Difficulty Level</h3>
<p>I'd say a medium. I am having a hard time getting my image to show up. <!--"The technology you use impresses no one, the experience you create with it is everything-Sean Gertety".-->I do like this assignment so far though!</em></p>

<h4>Hoping For The Best</h4>
<p>So far, I think I'm doing a good job. I thought about changing the font or the text color but also do not want points deducted for doing it. I will probably play around with that later.</p>
